This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to know.</p><p>The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.</p><p>At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with their flag in the Pacific.</p><p>For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects. While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern.</p><p>"What has he in his hand there?" cried Starbuck, pointing to something wavingly held by the German. "Impossible!&mdash;a lamp-feeder!"</p><p>"Not that," said Stubb, "no, no, it's a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he's coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don't you see that big tin can there alongside of him?&mdash;that's his boiling water. Oh! he's all right, is the Yarman."</p><p>"Go along with you," cried Flask, "it's a lamp-feeder and an oil-can. He's out of oil, and has come a-begging."</p><p>However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.</p><p>As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness&mdash;his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a CLEAN one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin.</p></div><div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--1-col"></div><div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--4-col"><div class="demo-card-wide mdl-card mdl-shadow--2dp"><div class=mdl-card__title><h2 class=mdl-card__title-text>Login</h2></div><div class=mdl-card__supporting-text><form id=accountLogin method=post action=#><div class="mdl-textfield mdl-js-textfield mdl-textfield--floating-label"><input class=mdl-textfield__input id=email name=first_name><label class=mdl-textfield__label for=email>Email</label></div><div class="mdl-textfield mdl-js-textfield mdl-textfield--floating-label"><input class=mdl-textfield__input type=password id=password name=last_name><label class=mdl-textfield__label for=password>Password</label></div><button class="mdl-button mdl-js-button mdl-button--raised" type=submit onclick="return loginDump()">Submit</button></form></div><div class="mdl-card__actions mdl-card--border"><div id=loginDump></div></div></div></div><script>function loginDump(){
